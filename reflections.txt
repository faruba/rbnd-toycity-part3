*How long did you spend working on this project?
about 4 hours -_-!
*What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
I think it is the process of refactoring the code. I implement there class one by one.
when I implement the second one. they are nealy same. so I abstract add_product, checking and add to array move up
and finally I found that add , all ,find_by should move to parent class.
I want to abstract this three function . add is easy. but all and find_by are class function.
I still don't figure it out
maybe some metaprogramming


*What two additional features did you build?  Why? 
1 print item in stock . it will help customer find out whether the product they want to buy is exsists or not
2 purchase history. Where dose my money go? this is the answer

*Where do you still have room to grow?
yes, I should read some book about ruby. there are lots of details I still don't know

I have some questions. could you help me? thank you
why differentiate between block and function ? 
def high_order_function(oprator, *args) 
  oprator(args)
end
def high_order_function (arg, &block) 
	block.call(arg)
	#yeild just a syntax suger ?
end

I guess
block is more like a closure (function + envirment) ?
function just don't have envirment  ?
